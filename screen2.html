      <h3 class="card-title">PASSION & Hobby</h3>
      <p class="card-text">
        <strong>Hobbys</strong> are to read and draw which i do quite
        nicely although my drawings are far form a pro but my skill of reading compensates for that, As per my
        <strong>PASSION</strong> is to code, my first introduction to this skill was by a senior who was working
        with python and trying to make a 2D game, I found it interesting and soon downloaded an ide to work with
        python the time i started i was having a <strong>HP laptop</strong> with a <strong>pentium
          processor</strong> with <strong>4GB</strong> RAM which after "hello world" took a hefty time to do
        the processing, believe me or not nothing can make a developer more angry than that, I didn't have money
        to buy a new one so i left learning pythonðŸ˜…, there was no choice other then learning another language
        ("to quit was never a choice") i asked a teacher and started learning c++ i learned about 65% of that
        and soon realized i was not into that so i went to youtube and went like "best programming language to
        learn in 2020"
